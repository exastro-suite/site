## What is this tool?

Exastro EPOCH is, by date, the newest software in the Exastro Suite. It is a tool specialized for "Offensive automation". The industry is seeing constant changes and requires more diverse elements than ever before. It has turned into a time where engineers simply cannot afford take several years to create a single system.

Exastro EPOCH is designed to  reduce development time by saving as much labor as possible in areas where creativity is not vital. Some of you reading this might think see Exastro EPOCH as a software different from the other ones in the Exastro suite. But it was born during the development of the first two, where we were met with challenges that we had to handle with trial and error. So Exastro EPOCH is the same in the sense that it is a system created based on challenges we had in the field.

And when it comes to the System life cycle, we think of EPOCH of an must-have item that everyone should use.

## Why is the world not seeing more Automation?

While the line of tasks between Build to Deployment is repeated multiple times, the time and effort required to automate them often outweigh the pros. I think that people believe that the tasks themselves aren't difficult and that it won't be so taxing doing them manually. That being said, the tasks are often repeated many  times. Not only will automating them save you many man-hours in the long run, but it will also heavily decrease, if not remove, the amount of human errors.

But what do we mean when we talk about "the burdens of automation"? Right now if someone wants to use CI/CD, they will often have to use and combine multiple tools and products. This requires then the user to select which software to use and learn about them. We started to see that we can optimize this process by reducing the time used to learn and choose the required software. That is  how Exastro EPOCH started.

## What are you focusing on when developing Exastro EPOCH?

In order to remove this stigma of Automating being a burden, we are developing Exastro EPOCH while focusing on making it an easy to use software that can easily help users implement CI/CD in to their projects.

## What are you aiming for with Exastro EPOCH?

Development broken down is to create something that didnâ€™t exist, which is a very creative task. Still, it comes with a heap of tasks that doesn't require creativity and takes up a lot of time.

We want to first and foremost reach out to a bigger audience by expand with more functions and open add more supported platforms, such as AWS and OpenShift. 

Additionally, we are thinking of implementing No code/Low code development to help deliver high-speed app development. And finally, we want to use Exastro EPOCH as a product to deliver environments where users can focus on value-creation.
