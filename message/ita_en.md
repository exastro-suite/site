This is the first software released in the Exastro Suite, "Exastro IT Automation"(hereinafter written as "ITA"). This application is a result of Mr. Yoshida, the founder of Exastro, and the Exastro ITA members who shared his hardships and brought their ideas. Is was made with the intent of automating individualistic system constructions which are often subject to human errors.

## What are you focusing on when developing Exastro ITA?

The balance between "Necessities" and "Versatility". Exastro is a tool made to Digitize, Optimize, and improve the labor saving of System constructions and operations. While it is  it is easy to consider specific scenes that the software could be applied to, it can be hard to find similarities between them. That being said, our team is always thinking of how we make the software more versatile. We are simulating numerous use cases and adding functions to the ones that seems most efficient in order. While it is harder to design a system that focuses not only one, but on a wide variety of use cases, our goal with Exastro ITA is to have many people use it.

## What hardships are you facing with developing ITA?

One of our continual problems is technical investigation. There are many amazing tools out there in the world. However, no tool in the world can do everything, and each tool has their own UI and controls. It can honestly be a chore to learn everything. Since Exastro is a tool that connects and allows users to use these applications with one UI, we are constantly having to learn all the different applications one by one. You can imagine how hard it is for us when one of these programs gets a big update.

## What is Exastro ITA aiming for?

When Exastro IT Automation 2.x released in fall 2022, we wanted the software to be more multi-tenant and easier to use.

People often think of Exastro ITA as a "program that is nice to have" and "not necessary when we can do it analog". We believe however, that the true value of this tool is not the "convenience" it provides. Analog tasks requires a human resources, which is not infinite. And one day, they will meet a limit.

We believe the mission of Exastro ITA is to fix this problem and create enough room and time for companies and engineers to expand their business. We also want to strengthen the connectivity between the other apps in the Exastro Suite, such as Exastro OASE and Exastro EPOCH, to pursue the goal of OneExastro.
