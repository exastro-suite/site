## What is this tool?

This is Exastro Operation Autonomy Support Engine (hereinafter written as Exastro OASE), the second software released in the Exastro Suite. It is a tool created to automate the process of handling system errors that occurs during system operation. I think we can all agree it is highly inefficient to have a human constantly monitor the operation when they don't know when the error occurs. Exastro OASE automatically decides what to do with the detected error. We are grateful, as it has gotten a lot of attention with it's clear merit.

## What are you focusing on when developing Exastro OASE?

In most cases, Exastro OASE operates without any people monitoring it.

In other words, if OASE doesn't function properly, the error detection might be delayed, causing even more problems before the automation. It is of utmost importance that the tool itself is reliable as well as correctly configured. That is one of the reasons why we choose to prioritize usability when developing Exastro OASE.

We also are aware that projects can operate for long periods, meaning that supervisor might change. Cases like these are some of the reasons why we focusing on making the software easy to use without requiring special expertise.

## What hardships are you facing with developing OASE?

One of the bigger ones are definitively technical investigations. In order to link with different software and support more systems, this is a step most dear to our development. We live in a world where systems are evolving every day. And in order to be able to support them, we must almost have our antennas set up high and sharp to follow what is new in the field. But we are also grateful, as everyone on our team learns something new everyday.

## What is Exastro OASE aiming for?

As mentioned before, systems are constantly evolving on a daily basis. But the operation and maintenance tasks supporting them are, and have been for a long time, done manually. Asking to automate all tasks overnight is too much and can be extremely risky. So we propose that you start with Exastro OASE first.

We are also happy that we went with OSS, as it allows us to use the comments and voices from everyone who has used the software to grow Exastro OASE to an even better tool for maintenance.
